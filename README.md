#SiFiLegends (This Plugin is has been replaced with a new plugin, SciFiLegends)

Endless Sky Plugin to add famous SiFi ships to game.

I enjoyed many of these ships in their respected media. So I have created them to have fun with in Endless Sky. This is Provided Free and is for Entertainment Purposes. Please Respect the original owners, and only use this for personal entertainment.

Once downloaded, place the folder "SiFiLegends" into the Endless Sky Plugin Folder.
